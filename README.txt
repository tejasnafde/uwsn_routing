UnetStack3 Community Edition
============================

Requirements
------------

Mac OS X / Linux / Windows*
Java 8 or higher installed
Chrome 61+ / Firefox 60+ / Safari 10.1+
PortAudio** (on Mac OS X and Linux)

*  Unet audio not supported on Windows yet
** only needed for Unet audio

Getting started
---------------

To open the simulator IDE on your computer, open a terminal window in the unet folder
(where this README.txt is) and try:

  bin/unet sim

This will start the simulator and open a browser window with a web-based IDE. In
the command shell in the IDE (bottom window), type:

  sim.run 'samples/aloha.groovy'

This will run the simulation script within the IDE. To find out more commands in
the IDE, type 'help' at the command shell within the IDE.

If you prefer to run simulations directly from the command line (without the IDE),
in the terminal window, you could directly try:

  bin/unet samples/aloha.groovy

If everything goes well, you should see an output similar to:

  Pure ALOHA simulation

If not, visit the support forum at http://www.unetstack.net/ to seek help on
resolving the problem.

To get going with developing your own networks, protocol and simulations, read
the Unet handbook at http://www.unetstack.net/handbook/

Note for macOS users
-----------------------

When you run UnetStack, if your Mac complains about opening an app from an
unidentified developer, you may need to update your security settings to say its okay.

After canceling the dialog about an unidentified developer, go to your Settings,
Security & Privacy, General, and say "Allow Anyway" for the warning telling you that the
libyoda library was blocked. Run UnetStack again, and say "Open" when you are warned
about this again. The Mac will then remember that it is okay, and will not ask you again.

For running Unet audio on macOS Apple Silicon machine, you'll need to make sure that both
the Java and the PortAudio library are running in the same architecture.
